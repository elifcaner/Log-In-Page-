registeredPage: is the page when the user successfully registered.
newPage: is the page when the user successfully logged in.
resetPass: is the page which will be used to send an email.
contact.html: is the page which will be used to see contact information.

These pages are implemented just for showing the layout and whether the functions 
work successfully or not. No design is done for these pages.

index.html: is the main Log in/Register page.

Note: Register Page's (verify function method) does not work. However, in Log in 
page, it works. The reason is due to design of Register and Log in screens are on
the same Page. I could change it (design them on seperate pages), but I do not 
want.
